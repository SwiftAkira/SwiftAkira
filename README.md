ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m @SwiftAkira (Call me Swift)!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building intelligent web applications and fueled primarily by caffeine.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin while deepening my expertise in full-stack development and AI integration.

### âœ¨ Featured Project: SmartScribe (AI Content Assistant)

I've been actively developing SmartScribe, an AI-powered platform designed to assist with academic writing and content transformation.

*   **Core Functionality:** Enables users to create projects, upload documents (source material + rubrics/requirements), and generate structured outlines based on specific AI settings and academic constraints.
*   **Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Supabase (Postgres, Storage, RLS), Clerk (Auth), Google AI (Gemini), Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, Vite.
*   **Key Features Implemented:**
    *   Secure multi-file uploads with Supabase Storage and signed URLs.
    *   Integration with Google Gemini for:
        *   Hierarchical outline generation tailored by user settings (length, style, document type, academic level, etc.) and text context.
        *   Automated extraction of academic requirements (citation style, word count) from uploaded rubric files using targeted AI analysis.
    *   Robust backend API with authentication and fine-grained data access control via Supabase RLS.
    *   Interactive multi-step frontend wizard using React, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, and react-hook-form.
*   *(This project involved significant full-stack debugging across authentication, database interactions, API logic, component state, and AI response handling.)*
